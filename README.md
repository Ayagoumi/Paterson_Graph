### Paterson Graph

The Petersen graph is an undirected graph with 10 vertices and 15 edges. It is a small graph that serves as a useful example and counterexample for many problems in graph theory

Let's consider a walk W in graph G, which consists of L verticles W1, W2, ...., WL. A string 'A'-'E' is realized by a walk W if the sequence of letters written along W is equal to S. Verticles can be visited multiple times while walking along W.

For exemple, S='ABBECCD' is realized by W = (0, 1, 6, 9, 7, 2, 3).

For exemple, S='ABB' is realized by W = (0, 1, 6).

For exemple, S='ABB' is realized by W = (-1).
